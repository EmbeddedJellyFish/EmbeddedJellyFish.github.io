# Team Organization

## Team Goals

* Design is completely functional by the demonstration deadline with no input from the team during the presentation.

* Benchmark assignments have been completed on time to provide adequate development time.

* Properly demonstrate the team’s PCB cadding skills, documentation, soldering and programing skills.

* The design is within the allocated budget ($240) while maintaining low risk for future investment and adaptation.

* The product adequately fullfils the weather and mobility requirements.

## Team Coordination and Accountability 

Using our preferred method of communication (discord) we will communicate with team
members to ensure everyone has “signed off” on submitting the assignment. We will ensure that
assignments are delivered on time by planning ahead so that we can have time to work on that
assignment. In the case an assignment is missed, we will submit it on the day immediately following the
due date. If the late assignment is due to missed contributions then appropriate action to take would be
discussed with the rest of the team and potentially the professor. Before every assignment we will assess
the skills required to complete the assignment and then distribute accordingly. If someone is comfortable
with programming for example then they would likely be distributed that load. However we will also take
into consideration the workload of what we distribute so no one person is doing a larger portion of the
assignment than the others. If a team member feels they lack the skills necessary to complete an
assignment, and that is communicated with us; we will adjust by providing them with the help they need.
It is the responsibility of each team member to complete their work, which also means if they are
struggling it is their responsibility to communicate that. We will likely not be able to recognize a team is
underperforming without proper communication or unless someone's portion is dependent on another
portion of the assignment being completed. For example you can't test and properly debug code if the
hardware is not complete. If a teammate is struggling and takes no measures to seek help from us, the
professors, or teaching assistants then a pink slip will be given. Lacking skills is something that we can
work with but we can’t work with someone that doesn’t put in the effort to learn or communicate.

## Procedures

Asynchronous - In asynchronous situations using our google drive folder will be the best way to
communicate and complete the work as each team member can work at their own pace without
the need of other team members to be present.
Synchronous - In synchronous situations using the team's discord will be most effective as the
team can join video and voice calls and complete our work at the same time while also being
able to communicate at that very moment.
Instructor Correspondence - Instructor correspondence will be done by the team leader (Skyler)
so communication can be organized with the instructor without multiple people reaching out for
help. The team leader can then report the communication with the instructor back to the team so
all team members can be on board with what was asked and how it was answered.

## Roles and Responsibilities 

Project roles will be changed after every major assignment to allow everyone to fulfill each
project role. We will decide who is assigned to each role by rotating down the given table. For example,
since Harris is starting as a meeting recorder, he would then become assignment leader when it is time to
switch. Team members will help each other meet their responsibilities through open communication and
collaboration. If someone is struggling with something and they communicate to us they need help, we
can then help each other. Team activities and milestones will be tracked using a google drive shared
folder. The technical responsibilities assigned to team members will be based on their strengths but other
factors such as preference can be considered. We will discuss when it is time to distribute technical
responsibilities and come to an agreement.

## Conflict Recognition and Resolution
Two methods of raising concerns or issues:

1. Commenting in the General Chat - Team members can talk to the team in the groupchat for issues
that would concern the group such as schedule conflicts for meetings or wanting to change roles.
- Resoution: Team works as a group to address the issu.
1. Messaging the Team Lead - Team members can talk to the team lead for more important issues
like inter-personal conflicts with other team members or falling behind in the classwork.
- Resolution: Team member and Team Lead work together to come to an understanding
and a plan moving forward to better address the issue.

The instructor will only be notified if communications within the group have been unsuccessful and the
problem has persisted. The other scenario where the instructor will be notified is when a team member
has failed to contribute or actively obstructed the team’s efforts to communicate and adhere to the
deliverable deadlines for 2 assignments in a row.
