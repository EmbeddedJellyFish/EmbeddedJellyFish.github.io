##  Team Organization

Team Charter - As a team we got together and thought about what we want our product to reflect for the team. It was decided that we want our team work and skills to be a part of our product since we are all passionate about engineering. The product will reflect our time management, team coordination, ideation, design, programming and the ability to put together a functional product.

Mission Statement - The goal for the product is to be a mobile weather station that accurately responds to environmental changes in real-time. This will be done over WiFi using the MQTT protocal that will help ensure seemless access to information.

## User Needs, Benchmarking and Requirements

When developing a product we regonized the importance of researching user needs and requirements. The team decided to take 5 similar products online and create a list of user needs and requirements. At first it was written down without any organization or formatting but as the process continued we grouped similar needs together, ranked user needs based off importance and then categorized them into groups. The team felt that the most important product requirements are functionality and safety; one of our team members said that the product must fullfil its purpose of existing and the product MUST be safe for users which is a good justification for ranking the importance the way we did. The product will be assessed according to requirements we detailed through team discussion, revisions and testing. In the case a requirement is not met, revisions will be made to address it.

## Design Ideation

We got together in person and had an informal discussion where people could communicate their ideas. Each group member was encouraged to give their ideas so everyone contributed. We found that this method worked best because when you are making ideas it is important to prevent one from filtering themself too much so that we can all give our thougts/iterate on that idea. We ranked ideas based on them fitting the requirements, their creativity and their practicality. Thanks to Skylar's excellent skills with computer sketching we were able to have a few visuals on potential ideas we discussed.
